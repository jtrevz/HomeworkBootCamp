# Code Refactor Homework

Refactored existing site to make it more accessible and organized it to improve readability. Fixed several bugs and condensed code.

## Semantic Tags

Existing code had mostly div tags for each section which made code confusing to read. Most importantly, added header/footer tags, as well as sections and aside tags to organize content.
